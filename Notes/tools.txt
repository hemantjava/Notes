Sonar - Open Source Project and Code Quality Monitoring

Olivier Gaudin, Freddy Mallet, SonarSource, http://www.sonarsource.com

What is Sonar ?

Sonar is an open source platform used by development teams to manage source code quality. Sonar has been developed with a main objective in mind: make code quality management accessible to everyone with minimal effort.

As such, Sonar provides code analyzers, reporting tools, defects hunting modules and TimeMachine as core functionality. But it also embarks a plugin mechanism enabling the community to extend the functionality (more than 35 plugins available), making Sonar the one-stop-shop for source code quality by addressing not only developers but also managers needs.

In terms of languages, Sonar support analysis of Java in the core, but also of Flex (ActionScript 3), PHP, PL/SQL and Cobol through plugins (Open Source or commercial) as the reporting engine is language agnostic.

Since version 2.0, Sonar enables to cover quality on 7 axes and so to report on:

Duplicated code
Coding standards
Unit tests(code coverage)
Complex code
Potential bugs
Comments
Design and architecture
Sonar can be used for one-off audits, but has been designed to support global continuous improvement strategy on code quality in a company and therefore can be used as a shared central repository for quality management.
