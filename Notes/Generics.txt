@Target
@Retention
@Inherited
@Documented

@Target
@Target tag is used to specify at which type, the annotation is used.

The java.lang.annotation.ElementType enum declares many constants to specify the type of element where annotation is to be applied such as TYPE, METHOD, FIELD etc. Let's see the constants of ElementType enum:

Element Types	Where the annotation can be applied
TYPE	        class, interface or enumeration
FIELD	       fields
METHOD	       methods
CONSTRUCTOR	   constructors
LOCAL_VARIABLE	local variables
ANNOTATION_TYPE	annotation type
PARAMETER	    parameter


@Retention annotation is used to specify to what level annotation will be available.

RetentionPolicy	Availability
RetentionPolicy.SOURCE	refers to the source code, discarded during compilation. It will not be available in the compiled class.
RetentionPolicy.CLASS	refers to the .class file, available to java compiler but not to JVM . It is included in the class file.
RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME	refers to the runtime, available to java compiler and JVM .

@Inherited
By default, annotations are not inherited to subclasses. The @Inherited annotation marks the annotation to be inherited to subclasses.

@Documented
The @Documented Marks the annotation for inclusion in the documentation.
